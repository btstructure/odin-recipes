    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
      I’ve specified boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe; they’re
      juicier and more flavorful than boneless skinless chicken breasts, and
      they also hold up better when using an acidic marinade; yogurt or
      lemon-based marinades can make boneless skinless chicken breasts leathery.
      Chicken thighs are also much easier to cook without drying out.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Make the Marinade In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, olive
        oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon
        juice, salt, pepper and garlic.

        Step 2: Prep the Chicken and Thread onto Skewers Trim the chicken of any
        excess fat and gristle. Don’t worry about getting every last bit of fat;
        most of it will melt off on the grill. Then cut the meat into bite-size
        pieces. I think it’s easiest to use kitchen shears as opposed to a
        knife. Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers alternating with the red
        onions. Metal skewers are ideal as they won’t catch fire on the grill.
        If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes first so
        they’re slower to char on the grill.

        Step 3: Marinate the Chicken Place the kabobs on a baking sheet lined
        with foil, and then brush the marinade all over the meat, coating well.
        Cover and let the kabobs sit in the fridge for at least 8 hours or
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Grill the Kabobs Preheat the grill to medium-high heat, grease
        well, and then grill the kabobs until golden brown.
